Problem Statement:
Building an AIoT (AI + IoT) based solution to prevent Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS).

Description:
Sudden infant death syndrome, sometimes known as cot death, is the sudden unexplained death of a child of less than one year of age. Diagnosis requires that the death remain unexplained even after a thorough autopsy and detailed death scene investigation. SIDS usually occurs during sleep.Our project encompasses the world of AI, IoT and MedTech and will be instrumental in saving the lives of thousands of children who die suddenly and without warning from this disease every year.

Abstract:
Sudden Infant Death Syndrome (SIDS) represents a critical and heartbreaking risk for infants, posing a significant challenge for parents and healthcare professionals alike. Despite advances in medical science, the exact causes of SIDS remain elusive, and effective preventative measures are limited. This project aims to address this issue by developing an innovative AIoT (Artificial Intelligence + Internet of Things) based solution to predict and prevent SIDS, thereby enhancing infant safety and providing peace of mind to parents.

Our proposed solution integrates advanced machine learning algorithms with IoT technologies to create a comprehensive monitoring system for infants. The system utilizes a network of smart sensors to continuously collect vital data, including heart rate, breathing patterns, body temperature, and sleep position. These sensors are designed to be non-intrusive and safe for use with infants.

The collected data is transmitted in real-time to a central processing unit where AI algorithms analyze the information to detect any anomalies or patterns indicative of potential SIDS risk. The AI model is trained on a large dataset of infant health metrics and historical SIDS cases, enabling it to make accurate predictions and trigger timely alerts.

In the event of detected irregularities, the system immediately notifies caregivers and healthcare providers through connected devices such as smartphones and smart home systems, ensuring rapid intervention. Additionally, the system provides a dashboard for long-term monitoring and analysis, allowing parents and doctors to track the infant's health trends over time.

This AIoT-based solution aims to significantly reduce the incidence of SIDS by providing a proactive and reliable monitoring system. Through the integration of AI and IoT, this project aspires to offer a cutting-edge tool in the fight against SIDS, ultimately safeguarding the lives of infants and alleviating the fears of parents globally.
